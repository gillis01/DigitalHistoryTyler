Mary Shelley (1797â€“1851) was an English novelist, short story writer, dramatist, essayist, biographer, and travel writer, best known for her Gothic novel "Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus" (1818).  The idea for "Frankenstein" came to her in a dream.  Her contributions to literature have been reevaluated in modern times, highlighting her as a significant figure in the Romantic literary movement.
